                  <h4>Sure, why not?</h4>
                  <h4>I didn't say it first, or best, but the difference between science and magic is largely
                    understanding. If you do a thing, and it works, and you know why, it is science. If you do a thing
                    and it (mostly) works, and you don't know why, that's magic.</h4>
                  <h4>The world was full of magic once, and that was good because the other option was no magic. We have
                    slowly ironed out and nailed down our magic into science, and that is also good because it makes
                    magic available for everyone.</h4>
                  <h4>We may cycle around to a magical world again, but for now, we have very little magic left.
                    Psilocybin, ayahuasca and the numerous cacti are where it grows.</h4>
                  <h4>It logically follows that if I am a skilled practitioner of these not understood magics, then I
                    must be a wizard of some sort. I have a robe and hat. I have a cauldron, wand, staff, and dagger. My
                    familiar is a cat named Wizard. So, yeah, it's my company and my job title, so I'm a wizard.

                  <h4>Setting is easier, but can still benefit from outside advice. Decluttering, removing stressful
